**1.**  **Abacus**: 
It is the most basic type of calculator where basic operations are done using beads.

**Cost : Rs 103onwards**

**2.**  **Basic (General Purpose) Calculators:**  This is a compact model with an LCD screen showing a line for figures. The display can show 8 up to 12 digits, depending on the calculator model.

**Cost: Rs 170 onwards**

**3.**  **Scientific Calculator:**  A scientific calculator is a type of electronic calculator, usually but not always handheld, designed to calculate problems in science, engineering, and mathematics. They have completely replaced slide rules in traditional applications and are widely used in both education and professional settings.

**Cost: Rs 330 onwards**

**4.**  **Graphing:**  A graphing calculator (also graphics calculator or graphic display calculator) is a handheld computer that can plot graphs, solving simultaneous equations, and performing other tasks with variables.

**Cost:**  Rs 1200 onwards

**5.**  **Printing:**  This is like the basic type of calculator that can help with business math functions. The main difference here is that this calculator can print out your equations, figures, and results. This can then print out your payroll time, profit margins, and even receipts. Lots of small businesses can make use of this type of calculator.

**Cost:**  Rs 2000 onwards

**6**.  **Online:**  These are the different types of calculator that you can find on the Internet that help people in various ways.
